        Platform Services
      </h2>
      <p>
        Misiki provides you with access to its Platform solely for the purpose
        of viewing brand profiles, submitting price quotes, facilitating
        communication with Brands with the objective of entering into a Campaign
        Agreement; and facilitating the transmission of payments from the Brand
        to the Influencers under a Campaign Agreement.
      </p>
      <h2>Third Party Websites</h2>
      <p>
        The Platform may provide links to third party websites. The content in
        any linked web site is not under Misiki’s control, and if you choose to
        access any such web site, you do so entirely at your own risk. Misiki
        may ask you to link your Misiki User Account to a third party social
        networking, email or content service such as Instagram, YouTube, Google,
        or Twitter. By granting access to us, you represent that you are
        entitled to disclose your third-party account login information to us
        without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern
        your use of the applicable site. By granting Misiki access to any
        third-party sites, you understand that we may access, make available and
        store (if applicable) any information, data, text, software, music,
        sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, tags and/or other
        materials accessible that you have provided to and/or stored in your
        third-party account so that it is available on the Misiki Platform. You
        have the ability to disable the connection between your Misiki Account
        and your third-party accounts at any time by accessing the “Settings”
        section. However, disabling such connections may limit your use of the
        Platform.
      </p>

      <h2>Relationship and Taxation</h2>
      <p>
        Your relationship with Misiki is that of an independent contractor, and
        you are not an employee, partner, legal representative, agent, or
        franchisee of Misiki. You are not entitled to employee benefits of any
        kind. You are responsible for paying your own income taxes in your own
        country of residence for any income derived from use of the Platform.
      </p>
      <h2>Campaign Agreements with Brands</h2>
      <p>
        You understand that Misiki facilitates the meeting of Influencers and
        Brands, but neither are hired by Misiki and all agreements are strictly
        between Influencers and Brand with the exception of the fee due to
        Misiki for each campaign completed. As such you accept that Misiki does
        not endorse any Brand or speak for them and the only responsibility that
        Misiki has between parties is the transmission of payments between them.
      </p>

        You agree to a one year exclusivity by Misiki over the transactions
        facilitated by parties who meet on this platform. You understand that
        you have an obligation to inform Misiki of all campaign agreements
        entered into between yourself and any Brand whom you met on this
        platform for a period of 1 year after the first campaign agreement has
        been made. You understand this obligation stands whether the future
        campaign agreements are agreed on the platform or not, if they happen
        within 1 year of the first campaign being agreed.
      </p>
